this small project was created to show different ways to share data between components in a react/nextjs app and to highlight the influence of these different methods on component rendering.

For the occasion I used [Easy-peasy](https://easy-peasy.vercel.app/ "Vegetarian friendly state for React") a library based on redux and its middleware, which allows to simplify the implementation of it on a project
